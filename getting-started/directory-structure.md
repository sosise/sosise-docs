# Project Directory Structure
## Overview
The default directory structure has been designed to offer a robust starting point for applications of varying sizes. While the layout provides a helpful organizational schema, you have complete flexibility in arranging your application structure. Sosise poses almost no constraints on where any particular class may reside.

## Primary Source (src) Directory
### Application (App) Directory
The `app` directory is the cradle of your application's core codebase. We will delve into its details shortly, but for now, it's sufficient to know that the majority of your application classes reside here.

### Configuration (Config) Directory
The `config` directory, as its name suggests, houses all configuration files for your application. We recommend a thorough review of these files to gain insight into the various options at your disposal.

### Database Directory
The `database` directory is reserved for your database migrations. Optionally, this directory can also host an SQLite database.

### Routes Directory
The `route` directory is where all route definitions for your application live.

## In-Depth Look at the App Directory
The `app` directory is the container for most of your application's code.

Within this directory, you will find a series of subdirectories, such as Console, Enums, Exceptions, Http, Libraries, Repositories, ServiceProviders, Services, Types, and Unifiers. The Console and Http directories essentially offer an API into your application's core, but they do not encapsulate application logic. They represent two different modes of issuing commands to your application: HTTP protocol and Command Line Interface (CLI). The Console directory contains all of your Artisan commands, while the Http directory houses your controllers and middlewares.

> Note: Many classes within the `app` directory can be auto-generated by Artisan commands. Use the `./artisan` command in your terminal to review the list of available commands.

### Console Directory
The `Console` directory hosts all custom Artisan commands and queue workers in your application.

#### Console/Commands Directory
The `Console/Commands` directory houses your custom application commands.

#### Console/QueueWorkers Directory
The `Console/QueueWorkers` directory contains all queue workers associated with your application.

### Enums Directory
The `Enums` directory accommodates all custom Enumerators you might establish in your application.

### Exceptions Directory
The `Exceptions` directory features your application's exception handler and serves as an ideal repository for all exceptions triggered by your application. To tailor how your exceptions are logged or rendered, make adjustments to the Handler class within this directory.

### Http Directory
The `Http` directory is home to your controllers and middlewares.

### Libraries Directory
The `Libraries` directory is a flexible space for any code that doesn't quite fit elsewhere.

### Repositories Directory
The `Repositories` directory is the central repository for your application's repositories.

### Services Directory
The `Services` directory houses all the services in your application. All application logic should be allocated here.

### Types Directory
The `Types` directory is the storage place for any Types you might create for your application.

### Unifiers Directory
The `Unifiers` directory accommodates all Unifiers for your application. Unifiers function similarly to Laravel's FormRequests and DTOs, encapsulating both into a single construct.
