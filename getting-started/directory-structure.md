# Directory Structure
## Introduction
The default application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both large and small applications. But you are free to organize your application however you like. Sosise imposes almost no restrictions on where any given class is located.

## The src Directory
### The App Directory
The `app` directory contains the core code of your application. We'll explore this directory in more detail soon; however, almost all of the classes in your application will be in this directory.

### The Config Directory
The `config` directory, as the name implies, contains all of your application's configuration files. It's a great idea to read through all of these files and familiarize yourself with all of the options available to you.

### The Database Directory
The `database` directory contains your database migrations. If you wish, you may also use this directory to hold an SQLite database.

### The Routes Directory
The `routes` directory contains all of the route definitions for your application.

## The App Directory
The majority of your application is housed in the `app` directory.

The app directory contains a variety of additional directories such as Console, Enums, Exceptions, Http, Libraries, Repositories, ServiceProviders, Services, Types, and Unifiers. Think of the Console and Http directories as providing an API into the core of your application. The HTTP protocol and CLI are both mechanisms to interact with your application but do not contain application logic. In other words, they are two ways of issuing commands to your application. The Console directory contains all of your Artisan commands, while the Http directory contains your controllers and middlewares.

> Many of the classes in the app directory can be generated by Artisan via commands. To review the available commands, run the `./artisan` command in your terminal.

### The Console Directory
The `Console` directory contains all of the custom Artisan commands in your application. These commands may be generated using the make:command command.

### The Enums Directory
The `Enums` directory contains all of the Enumerators you may create in your application.

### The Exceptions Directory
The `Exceptions` directory contains your application's exception handler and is also a good place to place any exceptions thrown by your application. If you would like to customize how your exceptions are logged or rendered, you should modify the Handler class in this directory.

### The Http Directory
The `Http` directory contains your controllers and middlewares.

### The Libraries Directory
The `Libraries` folder can be used for everything that does not fit in other folders

### The Repositories Directory
The `Repositories` directory contains all repositories of your application.

### The ServiceProviders Directory
The `ServiceProviders` directory contains simple IOC binding class.

### The Services Directory
The `Services` directory contains all services of your application. Please put your application logics to services.

### The Types Directory
The `Types` directory contains all of the Types you may create for your application.

### The Unifiers Directory
The `Unifiers` directory contains all of the Unifiers you may create for your application. Unifiers are similar to Laravel's FormRequests combined with DTO together.
