# Docker
Sosise supports docker out of the box. You can build your docker image with `build-docker-image.sh` script which can be found in the root directory

```sh
./build-docker-image.sh
```

> Just run it and follow the instructions

## The docker Directory
The `docker` directory contains all necessary files which are needed for building a docker image. Feel free to change anything you need for your project.
