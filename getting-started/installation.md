## Meet Sosise
Sosise is a web application boilerplate with an expressive, elegant syntax. A Sosise provides a structure and starting point for creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the details.

### Why Sosise
Because everything else is too complicated and not transparent.

## Your First Project
