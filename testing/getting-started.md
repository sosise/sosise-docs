# Getting Started
## Introduction
Sosise is built with testing in mind. In fact, support for testing is included out of the box.

By default, your application's tests directory contains two directories: Functional and Unit. Unit tests are tests that focus on a very small, isolated portion of your code. In fact, most unit tests probably focus on a single method or service.

Feature tests may test a larger portion of your code, including how several objects interact with each other or even a full HTTP request to a JSON endpoint.
